# Timi Olamide

Welcome. I’m a final-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at Covenant University, Nigeria — with a deep interest in robotics learning and control.

I build and study intelligent systems: from low-level microcontroller code and hardware-in-the-loop drone control, to simulation-based learning with JAX and MuJoCo. My work spans reinforcement learning, optimal control, and embodied intelligence.
