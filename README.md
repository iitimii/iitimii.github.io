I'm a final year EE student at Covenant University. Previously I worked with Dr. Daniel Omeiza at the Oxford Robotics Institue on autonomous driving and graph neural networks. I want to develop algorithms that actually think and constantly improve leading to super intelligence, which can be applied to robotics, operating systems, chatbots. I'm President of AEIES and Lead of the Robotics Research Team at Google Develope Groups CU where we've done rl and vla on manipulators
